# Vacation-Management
This software is designed to allow you to book vacations efficiently and conveniently.
The software has a user interface that lets you do some operations. Here are some of the key features of the system:

* Receive and register a guest in the system and enter the accommodation request he wants (date, number of vacationers, etc.).

* Receive and register a host who has hosting units.
The host will be able to view hosting requests that match the hosting units he has at his disposal,
thus offering the guests the hosting units he has, by sending an email (will execute by the system).

* Administrative actions (performed by the system administrator) such as viewing all hosting requests, viewing statistics, etc.
